# Craftsmen

PROBLEM STATEMENT

A good ecommerce website is one that lets customers search for what they want in an easy and convenient way. ‘Craftsman’ does this best by bringing the local industry online, which is suffering a lot from the e-commerce giants.
This eCommerce website sells a variety of products from bags to clothes, down to accessories which are traditional souvenirs.
Our vision is to keep the local talent alive, and boost the economy of the region by giving them an online platform to showcase their gems.
